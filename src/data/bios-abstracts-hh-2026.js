    "abstract1": "This technical presentation discusses the challenges faced by Class I railroads in North America in meeting aggressive greenhouse gas emission reduction goals set by the Science Based Targets initiative. The industry has historically improved fuel efficiency by an average of 1% per year, but to meet SBTi targets, a 6+% annual improvement is required. The paper focuses on statistical analysis tools to validate fuel savings technologies in the 1-3% range, which is challenging due to the high variability in fuel consumption and inaccurate locomotive fuel gauges. One promising technology for reducing fuel consumption and wear is locomotive wheel flange solid stick lubrication. The paper presents a case study on this technology, which involves applying a biodegradable solid lubricant to locomotive wheels.  Researchers at Kansas State University developed an environmentally friendly formulation using biopolymers and castor oil. Testing at dedicated rail facilities, such as the Transportation Technology Center (TTC) in Pueblo, Colorado, showed energy savings between 2% and 4.5% for both mechanical and electrical energy. Statistical analysis of the TTC tests, using methods like Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), revealed an overall fuel savings of 3.2% with a 90% confidence interval between 1.8% and 4.3%. The study also found that the lubricant reduced the outside rail gauge face coefficient of friction from 0.44 to 0.26 in a single pass. Further revenue field testing on a Class I railroad, involving over 500,000 individual crew trips, showed average savings of 1.4% to 1.8% depending on the number of locomotives equipped with lubricant brackets. The paper emphasizes the importance of rigorous statistical approaches and proper test design when evaluating fuel-saving technologies. It recommends using dedicated test facilities like TTC and MxV Rail for initial testing, followed by revenue field testing to account for variations between different railroads. ",

    "bio2": "He holds an M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the University of Calgary, with a focus on dynamic system modeling and simulation.",
    "abstract1": "In modern freight train operations, the control of in-train forces such as steady-state draft/buff and run-in/run-out forces is crucial for preventing derailments, equipment damage, and potential injuries. The increasing length, weight, and speed of trains necessitate a comprehensive approach to ensure safety and operational efficiency. In response, CPKC has developed the Active Train Analysis (ATA) system to monitor train conditions in real-time and detect potential risks.   The ATA system analyzes parameters such as train weight, length, and the maximum weight of cars behind an empty car to identify trains that might pose safety concerns. The system's alerts are then validated through detailed simulations of both real-time normal operations and hypothetical emergency scenarios. These simulations are carried out on the steepest grades and sharpest curves of the related track profile to test extreme wheel-rail interactions and their effect on in-train forces. The effectiveness of the ATA is evidenced by its high correlation with flagged risk scenarios, followed by the presentation of tested and approved alternative solutions to mitigate identified risks, which can lead to modifications in operational rules if necessary. ",
    "abstract2": "This proactive approach helps maintain operational efficiency while preventing service disruptions. This method underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and validation, providing valuable insights into optimizing train safety in an increasingly demanding operational environment. Future work will involve refining the ATA algorithms, expanding the monitoring parameters, and incorporating real-time feedback to further improve the system's reliability. A detailed analysis of field data and simulations is presented in this paper to verify the effectiveness of this proactive monitoring system."

Tyler Dick is Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin Safe, efficient, and reliable heavy haul railway transportation is vital to the North American economy and public mobility.  To maintain their status as the most efficient, environmentally sustainable form of land transport, railroads must create capacity to accommodate growing demand, become resilient to climate-related disruptions, and match or exceed the rapid reductions in energy and emissions being achieved by competing transportation modes.  Meeting these needs, while balancing the practicalities of capital-intensive railway infrastructure and rolling stock assets, presents heavy haul railroads with interesting and important future technological challenges.",

    "abstract1": "A hallmark of the Five Foundations of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), which much of the industry has adopted, is to Optimize Assets, using them more efficiently and productively.  A railroad’s Engineering Department may not be the source of revenue for a railroad but, they control and are tasked with managing the most valuable and vast asset —the railroad’s tracks.  Running an optimal Rail Life Cycle is not only part of PSR but, it is good general business practice for all railroads.   Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) has helped to eliminate Rail / Joint Based derailments over the past several decades. However, maintaining CWR has faced increased challenges as today’s Heavy Haul Railroads have looked to optimize Rail Life Cycles and extend the life of their rail, while also utilizing less track time, and maximizing network fluidity and trin speed.   Ultrasonic Testing quality and frequency have unquestionably helped to better identify defects and future rail breaks. Defects can now be identified, monitored, and repaired prior to experiencing an acute failure and in the worst-case scenario the associated extreme cost, network disruption, and any potential negative publicity that come with mainline derailments.     Electric Flash-Butt Repair Welding has become the high speed “pothole crew” for CWR and has the capability to eliminate defects in CWR very efficiently. However, this work scope requires continually locating 12’ to 20’ pieces of used rail or “plug rails” with matching head-loss & rail wear, which has become increasingly challenging.   Historically, employees have relied upon a stockpile of worn rail stored at their local depot / yard to remove defects and have been able to match head-loss / rail wear well enough that these pre-installed and mechanically jointed rail plugs could then be welded and the CWR restored during a secondary track block.    As rail wears more, candidate rails become harder to locate, especially as the stockpiles of matching plug rail become depleted as wear increases and frequency of repair also increases.  It has become increasingly inefficient to source, cut, and retain potential plug rails of various levels of wear, and it is time to move forward with a better approach, utilizing new technology and leveraging data collected by various track testing systems, coupled with a modern mobile inventory system.   The current standard length of the “plug rails” being utilized can be traced back to old / proper spacing of track joints required to prevent railcar rocking and also to the need to mechanically adjoin plug rails into place and for ability to create proper geometry when thermite welding at a later date.",
    "abstract2": "ONE | Rail Group and Norfolk Southern Railways are jointly looking at this challenge through a new lens and, have developed a plan to revolutionize how Repair Welding CWR can be done safer, better, and more cost effective.    By eliminating the current costs associated with the need to source, sort and UT test used plug rails and by utilizing Rail Inserts™ (a proprietary 5’ piece of rail that is milled to match various amounts of rail wear in-track) it will allow CWR repairs to be performed with less rail and also permanently install them via EFB welding in a single track-block instead of the current two track-block approach.   This process also leverages the data currently being collected by rail profile measurement systems and utilized for long-term rail replacement programs. The rail profile measurement data can now also predict the required Rail Insert™ sizes for each territory’s inventory and improve the tolerances allowed for rail mismatch during repairs.     The generally accepted industry standard for mismatch between rails to be welded is +/- 5mm, and we believe Rail Inserts™ can improve that mismatch variance consistently down to a mere +/-2mm.  This improvement will also improve the quality of the EFB Welds utilized in the repair process and make them a permanent repair that will last the remaining life of the CWR.   By utilizing new rail to manufacture a Rail Insert™ it also eliminates the potential of human error during the UT testing requirement for reusing old / worn rails to make CWR repairs and the safety risks associated with cutting, collecting, moving, sorting, storing, and redistributing the longer worn rails being utilized today.  If the parent rails in-track are more severely worn, it is also possible to gain improvement by utilizing lesser worn rail, which presumably has seen less tonnage, and to then mill down Rail Inserts™ to match the heavier worn rails in need of repair.   The cost of this process is still being completely defined but, initial evaluations actually show that the initial cost of the Rail Insert™ is either offset or an actual cost savings due to the significantly reduced mobilization costs and the elimination of wasted time handling materials, removing spikes, excessive grinding, and by having an organized / modern electronic inventory system.   Production scale manufacturing of Rail Inserts™ commenced in January 2025 and the initial installations will have been completed prior to WRI 2025, with productivity measures and tonnage performance monitoring feedback likely available for use in the presentation."

    "bio1": "Antonio Merheb is the Vice-Chair of the International Heavy Haul Association (IHHA) and a Consultant at MRS Logistics, a leading heavy haul railway operator in Brazil, responsible for transporting nearly 200 million tonnes of freight annually. His expertise spans railroad infrastructure and predictive maintenance for heavy haul operations.",
    "bio2": "Antonio holds a PhD in Transportation Infrastructure from the Polytechnic School, University of São Paulo, specializing in railway track performance and maintenance strategies. He also earned a Graduate Certificate in Railroad Engineering from the University of Delaware and a degree in Civil Engineering with a concentration in Geotechnics.",
    "abstract1": "Operating a Heavy Haul railroad system within the constraints of an aging infrastructure presents unique challenges, requiring tailored maintenance strategies and specialized track components. The MRS Logistics network, responsible for transporting nearly 200 million tonnes annually, operates on sections originally designed over 130 years ago, which were not dimensioned for modern heavy haul operations. This has led to accelerated track degradation, particularly in curves with short transitions, where improper superelevation contributes to higher lateral impact forces. Additionally, long-standing drainage deficiencies have compounded track degradation, particularly in modernized sections that include extensive bridges and tunnels.  In response, significant advancements in track and rolling stock technology were implemented between 2008 and 2014 to enhance wheel-rail interaction. Key measures included rail lubrication, rail grinding, the adoption of harder rail steels, and the development of a customized wheel-rail profile, all aimed at improving contact conditions and reducing wear.  However, as track life increased, and with the necessity of transitioning from wooden to concrete ties on nearly 50% of the network, new failure modes emerged. To mitigate these effects, since 2014, elastomeric materials have been introduced at critical interfaces:",
    "abstract2": "• For wood ties: The introduction of specially designed rail pads in tunnels has resulted in a 98% reduction in rail base fatigue fractures, a previously critical failure mode due to the difficulty of detection. • For concrete ties: The increase in track stiffness intensified issues such as rail seat abrasion (RSA) and accelerated ballast degradation. Solutions implemented include:  o Resilient rail pads, which have significantly reduced rail seat abrasion (RSA) while improving track support and stability.  o Under-tie pads (UTPs), which have enhanced the tie-ballast interface, increasing load distribution, reducing peak stresses, and minimizing ballast breakage and abrasion. Over the last 10 years, these measures have contributed to a more than twofold increase in average rail life, from 449 MGT to 914 MGT (both in curved and tangent track). Additional benefits include: • Reduction in tamping cycles by a factor of 2–3. • Extension of undercutting cycles by up to 8 years. • An additional 5 years of service life for ties. • A 20% increase in the overall lifespan of track components, as evidenced by recent instrumentation studies."
