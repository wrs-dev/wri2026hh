His experience spans the entire project lifecycle, from conceptualization to commissioning, including international tendering, procurement, and working with multi-lateral funding agencies, such as the World Bank. Shri Kumar has been involved with Dedicated Freight Corridors for more than a decade and at the vanguard of establishing the Dedicated Freight Corridor, one of modern India's most ambitious infrastructure project, which features complex engineering, design, and development. Shri Kumar has authored two authoritative books on Railway Engineering displaying his technical prowess and commitment to knowledge-sharing.",

Through his multidisciplinary expertise and academic training, he has helped fostered a culture of continuous learning within the DFCCIL, leading to innovative asset monitoring and maintenance practices with pioneering technologies, such as implementation of AI-based rolling stock inspection and drone-based rail monitoring to mention a few.",
    "abstract1": "The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corp. of India Ltd. (DFCCIL), under the Ministry of Railways, Government of India, is developing high-capacity freight corridors to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of rail logistics. The Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC), spanning approximately 1506 km, is designed for 32.5-ton axle load freight operations at speeds up to 100 km/h, connecting major industrial hubs across multiple states. WDFC exclusively employs 1080 Head Hardened (HH) rails, selected for their superior wear resistance and fatigue performance under heavy-haul operating conditions. Given the heavy axle loads and high gross million tonnes (GMT) traffic, the rail-wheel interface is subjected to accelerated wear and fatigue, making preventive rail grinding essential for sustaining track integrity. However, operational and resource constraints have limited consistent adherence to prescribed grinding frequencies in some WDFC sections. This study draws directly from DFCCIL's in-service field data, collected over a nearly 12-month monitoring period at 2 to 3 months interval, across multiple WDFC sections. The dataset includes time-lapsed measurements of rail wear, surface defects and hardness variation, analysed to assess the effects of deferred grinding on rail performance.",
    "abstract2": "Findings show that compliance with the prescribed grinding frequency maintains wear within acceptable limits and effectively suppresses surface defect propagation. In contrast, extended intervals between grinding cycles are associated with a measurable rise in surface defects and increased wear. Hardness testing revealed localized reductions below the standard range, particularly near defect sites, suggesting an increased susceptibility to fatigue initiation under repetitive loading. This study represents the first India-based investigation to systematically quantify the impact of varying grinding frequencies on Head Hardened rails over time. These findings reaffirm the critical importance of timely and data-informed rail grinding for maintaining long-term track integrity and reducing corrective maintenance. Building on these insights, DFCCIL is advancing toward a predictive, performance-based maintenance regime leveraging analytics, enhanced grinding capacity and localized optimization to deliver a scalable model for sustainable heavy-haul rail management.",

Shattered rims have decreasing due to tightened AAR ultrasonic inspection standards, improved cast wheel risering, argon stirring, and other clean steel initiatives made by wheel manufacturers. Vertical Split Rims (VSRs) are under investigation by a group sponsored by the US Federal Railroad Administration and significant Finite Element Analysis (FEA) work has been completed. However, there has been a noticeable increase in Association of American Railroads (AAR) Why Made Code (WMC) 66, cracked or broken flange over the last decade. WMC 66 is now the most frequent wheel failure cause. AAR Car Repair Billing and MD115 wheel failure data will be presented and discussed.",
    "abstract2": "Flange failures were once very rare but seem to have increased while flange bearing frogs and crossing diamonds have proliferated in our industry. Flange bearing trackwork has been of great benefit to the industry and has reduced the amount of field repair welding, changeouts, and track maintenance costs. However, the tip of the flange was not designed to carry the weight of the freight car, and it is possible that damage is being caused there. The author recommends an in-depth industry look at the interaction between the wheel's flange and these special trackwork items. Also discussed are unusual wheel plate failures where an impact has occurred to the plate, causing cracking. The importance of wheel inspection and handling are highlighted, and the industry needs to find those locations and circumstances that lead to plate impact damage.",

    "abstract1": "The most common failure modes in freight railroad wheels in North America are shattered rims, vertical split rims, and plate failures. Although less common, occasionally wheels fail due to fatigue cracks initiating at the back rim surface. These failure modes have been the root cause of derailments. BNSF Railway along with other Class I Railroads in North America reported wheel failures involving fatigue cracks initiating at the back rim surface. BNSF has noticed an increase in the frequency of derailments caused by this failure mode with six derailments occurring between the years 2019 and 2023. These failures have occurred in both forged and cast wheels from different wheel manufacturers. This failure mode is not new. Previous work by Opinsky [1] presented his findings on this type of failure which were mainly related to visual inspection, data, and fracture mechanics. There were no metallographic findings reported. In this study, using metallographic methods, the authors showed that the cause of the failure was thermally induced fatigue cracking which initiated in the back rim surface where there was a band of scraping marks. Metallographic testing conducted on the failed and mate wheels of six different wheelsets received from BNSF derailments which occurred from 2019 to 2023 revealed similar results.",
    "abstract2": "With a field test, the authors showed a likely cause of the scrape marks in the back rim is heavy interference contact between this area of the wheel (back rim) and a track component such as a guard rail. It was also proven the interference contact with guard rails set at the FRA Class 1 guard face gage limit, created enough thermal input to develop a thin untempered martensite layer with cracks in brand new wheels. Macroetched rim cross sections of the wheels by the authors revealed the failed wheel rims also suffered macro/microstructural damage in the tread area induced by high thermal input from the brakes. The location of the thermal damage is consistent with thermal input from brake shoes/tread braking. Presence of the effected microstructure in the failed wheels and absence of the same effect in the mate wheels in all six wheelsets tested by the authors in this study likely suggest the heat damage due to brakes observed in the failed wheels may have relieved some or all the beneficial compressive residual hoop stress imparted in the wheel during wheel manufacturing/heat treatment. Loss of the compressive residual hoop stress could be a key factor in allowing fatigue crack growth to propagate out of the thermal crack initiation sites generated by heavy scraping on the back rim surface. Visual examination of wheels in service by the authors revealed the majority of wheels contain scrape marks in the back rim surface similar to the failed wheels in this study. This type of failure is rare which suggests the root cause is a combination of the scraping producing thermal cracks which can initiate fatigue followed by braking issues degrading the beneficial compressive residual hoop stress in the rim.",

    "abstract1": "The railway turnout is a crucial and important part of the railway track as it allows trains to switch between tracks, therefore forming a network. These assets are subjected to elevated dynamic forces and (especially in heavy haul networks) rapid tonnage accumulation over relatively short timeframes, making turnout performance highly dependent on robust and targeted maintenance strategies. Rail grinding plays a critical role in this context by managing rail profile geometry to ensure appropriate load distribution through the turnout, thereby reducing the risk of defects, fatigue, and accelerated wear. Effective turnout maintenance requires consideration not only of when and how grinding is executed, but also of the grinding strategies adopted. This paper discusses common defect types observed on high axle-load turnouts and the management approaches currently implemented to control their progression in Australian heavy haul networks. The challenges in (Australian) heavy-haul turnout grinding will be examined with a focus on strategy development for defect correction and profile reinstatement to maximise turnout life and ensure performance compliance.",

Operating on a Cape gauge (1067 mm) track, the line was designed for high axle loads and long-haul coal transportation through demanding terrain and tropical climatic conditions. Overtime it has experienced progressive rail wear, Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF), GCC and surface degradation - conditions influenced by limited preventive maintenance and the absence of structured and effective rail reprofiling regime. A joint field investigation by NACALA Logistics and Vandhana International Pvt. Ltd. (India) was conducted to assess the extent of rail distress and develop a practical rehabilitation strategy. The assessment included visual inspections, Dye Penetrant Testing for crack detection and MiniProf profile measurements across representative sections to evaluate wear progression, plastic flow and profile distortion. The results indicated a gradual increase in surface and sub-surface defects - such as gauge-corner cracking, plastic flow and localized metal loss - primarily due to lack of systematic rail reprofiling (grinding) in recent years. These observations underline the need for a structured, condition-based grinding program to restore optimal wheel–rail contact geometry and improve rail life-cycle performance.",
    "abstract2": "The study addresses two critical dimensions: first, understanding the evolution of rail deterioration under constrained maintenance practices; and second, demonstrating how a rail grinding-based rehabilitation framework can stabilize wheel-rail dynamics, mitigate fatigue initiation and enhance long-term asset performance. Importantly, the paper presents rare, field-derived evidence from a Cape-gauge heavy-haul operation - a track gauge still dominant across Africa but largely absent from contemporary wheel–rail research. The findings show that global best practices in wheel-rail interface management can be successfully adapted to Cape-gauge systems, offering measurable improvements in safety, reliability and operational efficiency. The work provides a benchmark for heavy-haul operators in Africa seeking sustainable, data-driven rail maintenance strategies suited to local operating environments, especially the cape gauge lines.",

    "abstract1": "Strategic friction management is becoming a critical component of modern heavy haul operations, proven to reduce lateral forces, minimize rail wear, and mitigate derailment risks. While the benefits of optimized friction management are well documented, quantifying these benefits in the field has historically required expensive instrumented wheelsets or labor-intensive strain gauge installations. This presentation will introduce a recent pilot project on a Class 1 railroad that utilized a never-before-seen under-rail clamp technology to capture these critical performance metrics.",
    "abstract2": "The presentation will focus on the deployment of this novel clamp, which utilizes active ultrasonic reflectometry to measure dynamic stresses in the rail without the need for drilling or permanent bonding. Field data collected from the site compares Lateral/Vertical (L/V) force ratios under two distinct conditions: dry rail and rail treated with top-of-rail friction modifier. The analysis will highlight the direct correlation between the application of friction modifier and the reduction of L/V ratios on curves. By reviewing these comparative results, this session will demonstrate both the effectiveness of the friction management program and the viability of this new, non-invasive measurement technology as a tool for rapid performance validation.",
